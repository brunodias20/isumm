I created this project based on a personal need of having a summarized view of my investiments. The idea is to have manually record monthly operations (i.e. balance, deposits or withdrawal) and properly generates a simple summary views of investments.

Main goals:

* Simple: no crazy JS or animations. As much stuff done server side as possible
* Super secure: users will have their own instance (app engine) of the whole app (include the complete datastore). The app will require google login and only one pre-configured user will have access to the instance
* Open source: just because :D 

## Main concepts

* The basic unit of time is month. Everything is (sooner or later) aggregated by month.
* Operation: something that happened to your investment account: Deposit, Withdrawal and Balance.
    * Withdrawal and Deposit: used to calculate month-by-month profit.
    * Balance: for the sake of simplification, only one is considered per month. If you added more than one balance operations, only the most-recent is used.
* Investment: yeah, the name says everything. It groups a set of operations.

## Dev Notes
### Getting code coverage on GAE
GAE has a different definition of workspace and does not share your $GOROOT. To get everything up and running one should:
```bash
$ goapp install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/cover
$ goapp test -v -coverprofile=/tmp/coverprofile.out; goapp tool cover -html /tmp/coverprofile.out
```

### Deleting production data
It will be more and more rare, but if isumm devs change the schema, one is going ot need to clean up the production data store (sorry for that). To do so, go to your development console, on the top-right menu -> datastore, then setting  and enable Datastore Admin. After that Open Datastore Admin and delete all entities. 

A map reduce will be kicked off to execute the operation. Please take a sit and relax (good time for a coffee).
